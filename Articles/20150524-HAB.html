      <p>We launched a balloon up to 60,087 ft. (highest APRS ping; probably got higher), and then it came back down in a stand of trees. Not the open field right next to trees, but in the trees. 30m up a pine tree with no low branches.</p>
      
      <p>After...four? Five? Some large number of retrieval attemps, we managed to get the balloon back down. The combined efforts of a bow, fishing pole, several lengths of string and rope, and a grappling hook were able to dislodge the payload. Thanks to Tim for his help!</p>
      
      <p>We had some identified issues with the APRS after it got in the air, but we did receive <a href="/hosted files/APRS packets.txt">five packets.</a> We'll post a link to the video it took after someone uploads it to YT.</a></p>
