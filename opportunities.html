      <p>"Earthrise Space, Inc., is a non-profit research laboratory and student training ground. The company has the goal of providing students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience designing, building, testing and operating real spacecraft. It is our belief that the skills and knowledge gained from this unique experience will provide students with a significant advantage as they enter the workforce and seek high-tech jobs in aerospace or related industries. ESI allows students to take on the responsibility of designing and building complex spacecraft systems. The company forces them to work together with other students, company management and senior engineering advisers and experts in a fast paced, multi-disciplinary environment. Students must satisfy challenging engineering constraints and manage customer requirements. They are encouraged to innovate and explore, and to learn from and overcome mistakes that are made along the way. These efforts provide the students with critical real-world experience unavailable to them from the classroom or through internships with large corporations.</p>
      
      <p>ESI is excited to be a part of this game-changing time in space exploration, where government ventures are being supplemented and in some cases completely replaced by private, entrepreneurial "NewSpace" companies. This barnstorming era is seeing the development of new innovations, breakthroughs, and capabilities which are enabling and driving forward commercial exploration and development of space. ESI, through participation in the Google Lunar X PRIZE, and through other projects, intends to expose students to this new industry, while providing them with the skills, knowledge, and experience they need to actively make a difference in it. Humanity is on a path to the stars, and ESI is doing its part to help us on our way." </p>
