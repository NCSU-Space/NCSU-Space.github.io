      <p>This was a project to build a prototype of a free-flying telepresence drone for the ISS, very similar to the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/military-robots/nasa-new-freeflying-robot-to-conquer-iss-in-2017">'Free Flying Robot'</a> that NASA announced later.</p>
      
      <p>We built a prototype with a selection of low-power fans, designed for safe operation in a pressurized microgravity environment. It's a bit like a quadcopter with a video camera, but since it doesn't need to fight gravity and does need to not break anything, the fans are much smaller.</p>
      
      <p>The brains were supplied by an Odroid U3, a single-board Linux computer with a good bit more CPU power than the Raspberry PI. Fans were controller by a microcontroller and custom motor driver PCB. The UI was a web interface which presented low-latency streaming video, and gamepad and keyboard control to a Firefox or Chrome browser with no additional plugins or client software. A relay server was placed between the bot and users to handle video load and provide a security override.</p>
      
      <p>Control software and misc. other things available in our <a href="https://github.com/NCSU-Space/Astropresence">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
      
      <p>We also submitted a <a href="/hosted files/ISSProposal.pdf">proposal</a> to CASIS for an earlier smartphone-based version of this project.</p>
